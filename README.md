# UMAP 3D Visualization - MSHA Data

Supplementary materials for: [Your Paper Title]

## Description
This repository contains interactive 2D and 3D UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) visualizations of the MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) accident dataset.

## Files
- `3D_visualization_of_UMAP_embeddings_against_MSHA_variables.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing interactive UMAP visualizations script
- `data_with_kmeans_cluster_labels_and_umap_embeddings_of_different_scenarios.7z` - Raw MSHA accident dataset that includes the 3D and 2D emeddings of narratives and merged narratives along with other variables and kmeans clusters labels for main clusters and subclusters (final_clusters) 

## Usage
1. Download both files to your local machine
2. Unzip the datafile
3. Install jupyter notebook or any other environemnt that support .ipynb
4. Install required Python packages
